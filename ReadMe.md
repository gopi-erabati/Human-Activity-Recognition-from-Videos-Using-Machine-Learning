Nowadays, itâ€™s a very hot topic on video-based human action detection, which has recently been demonstrated to be very useful in a wide range of applications including video surveillance, tele-monitoring of patients and senior people, medical diagnosis and training, video content analysis and search, and intelligent human computer interaction. Actions can be characterized by spatiotemporal patterns. Similar to the object detection, action detection finds the reoccurrences of such spatiotemporal patterns through pattern matching. 
I worked on few types of interest-point based feature extractions like Spatio-Temporal Interest Point (STIP), 3D SIFT and Histogram of Oriented Optical Flow (HOOF) features. With the use of SVM classifier, I classified the actions. I implemented this human activity recognition on KTH dataset which has six actions like boxing, hand waving, hand clapping, jogging, running and walking of nearly 100 videos each.
